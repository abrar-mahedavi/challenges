`Medium`	`Codewriting` 	`300`

## Description

Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
You are given a string consisting of words separated by whitespace characters, where the words consist only of English letters. Your task is to swap pairs of consecutive words and return the result.

**Example**
- For `s = "CodeFight On"`, the output should be `solution(s) = "On CodeFight";`
- For `s = "How are you today guys"`, the output should be `solution(s) = "are How today you guys".`

**Input/Output**

- **[execution time limit] 4 seconds (js)**

- **[input] [memory limit] 1 GB**

- [input] string s \
 A string consisting of whitespace characters `(' ')` and English letters. There is exactly one whitespace character between two consecutive words, and both the first and the last characters of `s` are not equal to `' '`.

- Guaranteed constraints:
  `0 ≤ s.length ≤ 100`.

- **[output] integer**


## [Java] Syntax Tips

``` java
// Prints help message to the console
// Returns a string
// 
// Globals declared here will cause a compilation error,
// declare variables inside the function instead!
String helloWorld(String name) {
    System.out.println("This prints to the console when you Run Tests");
    return "Hello, " + name;
}
```
