`Medium`	`Codewriting` 	`300`

At the end of every semester your professor for "Introduction to Databases" saves the exam results of every student in a simple database system. In the database table Grades, there are five columns:

- Name: the name of the student;
- ID: the student's ID number (a 5 byte positive integer);
- Midterm1: the result of the first midterm out of 100 points;
- Midterm2: the result of the second midterm out of 100 points;
- Final: the result of the final exam, this time out of a possible 200 points.

According to school policy, there are three possible ways to evaluate a grade:

- Option 1:
  - Midterm 1: 25% of the grade
  - Midterm 2: 25% of the grade
  - Final exam: 50% of the grade
- Option 2:
  - Midterm 1: 50% of the grade
  - Midterm 2: 50% of the grade
- Option 3:
  - Final exam: 100% of the grade.

Each student's final grade comes from the option that works the best for that student.

As a Teaching Assistant (TA), you need to query the name and id of all the students whose best grade comes from Option 3, sorted based on the first 3 characters of their name. If the first 3 characters of two names are the same, then the student with the lower ID value comes first.

## Example

- For the following table Grades

| Name     | ID    | Midterm1 | Midterm2 | Final |
|----------|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| David    | 42334 | 34       | 54       | 124   |
| Anthony  | 54528 | 100      | 10       | 50    |
| Jonathan | 58754 | 49       | 58       | 121   |
| Jonty    | 11000 | 25       | 30       | 180   |

- Output should be

| Name     | ID     |
|----------|--------|
| David    | 42334  |
| Jonty    | 11000  |
| Jonathan | 58754  |

For David, Jonty and Jonathan, the best option is number 3. But Anthony's best option is the second one, because Option1 = 25% of 100 + 25% of 10 +50% of 50 = 52.5, Option2 = 50% of 100 + 50% of 10 = 55, Option3 = 100% of 50 = 50.
