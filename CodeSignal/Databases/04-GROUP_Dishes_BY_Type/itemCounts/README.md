You recently started working in the IT department of a large store. You were put in charge of the inventory database availableItems, which has the following structure:

- id: unique item ID;
- item_name: the name of the item;
- item_type: the type of the item.

Note that it is possible for items that are of different types to have the same names.

One of the most common operations performed on this database is querying the number of specific items available at the store. Since the database is quite large, queries of this type can take up too much time. You have decided to start analyzing this problem by counting the number of each available item.

Given the availableItems table, write a select statement which returns the following three columns: item_name, item_type and item_count, containing the names of the items, their types, and the amount of those items, respectively. The output should be sorted in ascending order by item type, with items of the same type sorted in ascending order by their names.

## Example

- For the following table availableItems

| id   | item_name       | item_type   |
|------|-----------------|-------------| 
| 1    | SafeDisk 4GB    | USB drive   |
| 2    | SafeDisk 8GB    | USB drive   |
| 3    | Cinco 50-Pack   | DVD         |
| 4    | SafeDisk 4GB    | Memory card |
| 5    | SafeDisk 8GB    | Memory card |
| 6    | Cinco 30-Pack   | DVD         |
| 7    | SafeDisk 4GB    | Memory card |
| 8    | SafeDisk 4GB    | Memory card |
| 9    | DiskHolder      | Misc        |
| 10   | Cinco 50-Pack   | DVD         |
| 11   | SafeDisk 4GB    | USB drive   |
| 12   | DiskCleaner Pro | Misc        |

- the output should be

| item_name       | item_type   | item_count |
|-----------------|-------------|------------| 
| Cinco 30-Pack   | DVD         | 1          |
| Cinco 50-Pack   | DVD         | 2          |
| SafeDisk 4GB    | Memory card | 3          |
| SafeDisk 8GB    | Memory card | 1          |
| DiskCleaner Pro | Misc        | 1          |
| DiskHolder      | Misc        | 1          |
| SafeDisk 4GB    | USB drive   | 2          |
| SafeDisk 8GB    | USB drive   | 1          |
