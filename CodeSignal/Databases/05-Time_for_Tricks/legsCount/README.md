You really love counting stuff. In fact, right now you're sitting on a meadow and counting all the legs you see there! There are some people, some dogs, and some cats on the meadow. You're pretty confident that each human has 2 legs and that cats and dogs have 4 legs each.

The information about all the creatures on the meadow is stored in the table creatures. It has the following structure:

- id: the unique creature ID;
- name: the creature's name;
- type: the creature's type - "human", "cat", or "dog". This column has ENUM type.

You want to calculate the total number of legs in the meadow. Given the table creatures, build a new table that only contains one column summary_legs and has only one row with the total number of legs that you can see.

## Example

- For the following table creatures 

| id  | name  | type  |
|-----|-------|-------| 
| 1   | Mike  | human |
| 2   | Misty | cat   |
| 3   | Max   | dog   |
| 4   | Tiger | human |

- the output should be

| summary_legs |
|--------------|
| 12           |

- There are 2 humans, 1 cat, and 1 dog, so there are 2 * 2 + 1 * 4 + 1 * 4 = 12 legs in total.
