You own a small company, and you keep track of its income in the accounting table, which has the following structure:

- date: a unique date on which your company was open (of type date);
- profit: the amount of money your company earned that day (of type int unsigned);
- loss: the amount of money your company lost that day (of type int unsigned).

You've decided to sell the company, and in order to make the offer more appealing to potential buyers you need to create a financial report.

Given the accounting table, write a select statement which returns three columns: year, quarter and net_profit. The first column should contain the year, the second one should contain the quarter of that year, and the third one should contain the net income (profit - loss difference) of your company during that period. The output should be sorted by the year in ascending order. If there are several rows with the same year, sort them by the quarter in ascending order.

Don't include year/quarter in the answer if there is no entry for it in the accounting table.

## Example

- For the following table accounting

| date       | profit | loss   |
|------------|--------|--------|
| 2006-01-01 | 100    | 15     |
| 2006-07-15 | 40     | 100    |
| 2006-08-01 | 50     | 50     |
| 2006-11-11 | 100    | 50     |
| 2006-12-01 | 50     | 80     |
| 2007-05-03 | 42     | 16     |

- the output should be

| year | quarter | net_profit |
|------|---------|------------|
| 2006 | 1       | 85         |
| 2006 | 3       | -60        |
| 2006 | 4       | 20         |
| 2007 | 2       | 26         |
