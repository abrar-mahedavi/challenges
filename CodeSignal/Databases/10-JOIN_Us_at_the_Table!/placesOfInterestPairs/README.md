You're going on vacation in a big city, and you've prepared a list of all the sights you'd like to visit. As you don't have much time and can't spend a whole day at one interesting place, you want to visit several sights per day and walk from one site to another. But walking a long distance might be boring, so you won't walk between two places if the distance between them is 5 km or more.

To find the route that you should take, you are going to find all pairs of places that are less than 5 km from each other.

The places of interests are stored in a table sights, which has the following attributes:

- id: the unique ID of the place;
- name: the name of the place;
- x: the x coordinate of the place;
- y: the y coordinate of the place.

The distance between the places is calculated with the assumption that they are just points on a 2D map.

Given the sights table, find all pairs of places that are less than 5 km from each other and return them as a table with the columns place1 and place2. Sort them in lexicographical order. The places in the pairs should also be sorted lexicographically.

## Example

- For the following table sights

| id  | name             | x         | y        |
|-----|------------------|-----------|----------|
| 1   | Tower of London  | 51508.026 | -7.5939  |
| 2   | Trafalgar Square | 51508.040 | -12.7899 |
| 3   | London Eye       | 51503.538 | -11.9371 |
| 4   | The Shard        | 51504.533 | -8.6028  |

- the output should be

| place1     | place2           |
|------------|------------------|
| London Eye | The Shard        |
| London Eye | Trafalgar Square |
| The Shard  | Tower of London  |
