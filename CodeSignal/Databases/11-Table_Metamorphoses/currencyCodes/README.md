Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
You are developing an application for working with different currencies. You've decided to represent each currency using three letter codes from ISO 4217.

You've parsed some data that you found on the Internet and stored it in a currencies table, which has the following structure:

- code: the unique code of the currency;
- country: the name of the country in which this currency is used.

Unfortunately, your parser didn't check the length of the codes and some erroneous data got into the table by mistake.

Your task is to delete all rows from the currencies table in which code is not exactly three letters long.

## Example

- The following table currencies

| code | country   |
|------|-----------|
| AD   | Andorra   |
| AUD  | Australia |
| BRL  | Brazil    |
| MXN  | Mexico    |
| RUB  | Russia    |
| RUR  | Russia    |
| SEKR | Sweden    |
| USD  | USA       |

- should become

| code | country   |
|------|-----------|
| AUD  | Australia |
| BRL  | Brazil    |
| MXN  | Mexico    |
| RUB  | Russia    |
| RUR  | Russia    |
| USD  | USA       |
