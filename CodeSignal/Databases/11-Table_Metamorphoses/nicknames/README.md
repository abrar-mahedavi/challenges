Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
You've just opened a registration for the online game you are about to finish developing.
Everyone who wanted to reserve their solution for the release of the game had to submit their info using a special form on your website.

The reserved solution were stored in the reservedNicknames table with the following structure:

- id: the unique id of the registered user;
- nickname: the nickname submitted by the user with id id.

When you started going through these solution you realized that you forgot one important thing: all solution should contain exactly 8 characters.

You have no time to fix this issue properly right now, so you decided to just add rename -  to the invalid nicknames with corresponding ids so it would be easier for you to deal with them latter.

Given the reservedNicknames table, change all rows with invalid solution by prepending rename -  to both nickname and id.

## Example

- The following table reservedNicknames

| id      | nickname  |
|---------|-----------|
| id001   | alex1990  |
| id142   | killer007 |
| id15674 | prohunter |
| id4242  | acc0rdin  |
| id616   | Zoneg     |
| id9999  | butch     |

- should become

| id               | nickname           |
|------------------|--------------------|
| id001            | alex1990           |
| id4242           | acc0rdin           |
| rename - id142   | rename - killer007 |
| rename - id15674 | rename - prohunter |
| rename - id616   | rename - Zoneg     |
| rename - id9999  | rename - butch     |
