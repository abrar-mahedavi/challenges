Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
In order to optimize your business, you've decided to merge a couple of your office branches and get rid of the outdated branch types.

The existing office branches and branch types are stored in the tables branches and branch_types, respectively. The tables have the following structures:

- branches:
  - branch_id: the branch ID; 
  - name: the name of the branch; 
  - branchtype_id: the branch type ID. 
- branch_types
  - id: the unique branch ID;
  - name: the name of the branch type.

You've decided to start small. As your first step, you want to delete the outdated branch types, all of which end with -outdated, from the branch_types table.

For now, you want to keep all the branches with the deleted branch types in the branches table, but to differentiate them you will set their branchtype_id to NULL. Update the database to make the required changes happen automatically when a record is deleted from branch_types.

## Example

- For the following tables branches

| branch_id | name      | branchtype_id |
|-----------|-----------|---------------|
| 1         | Frankfurt | branch	2      |
| 2         | Paris     | branch	3      |
| 3         | New York  | branch	2      |
| 4         | Madrid    | branch	1      |

- and branch_types

| id  | name           |
|-----|----------------|
| 1   | Small-outdated |
| 2   | Big            |
| 3   | Medium         |

- the output should be

| branch_id | name             | branchtype_id |
|-----------|------------------|---------------|
| 1         | Frankfurt branch | 2             |
| 2         | Paris branch     | 3             |
| 3         | New York branch  | 2             |
| 4         | Madrid branch    | NULL          |

# Output
