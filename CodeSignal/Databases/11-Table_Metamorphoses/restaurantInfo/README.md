You are managing a restaurant recommendation service that has recently started to gain popularity.

The information about the restaurants is currently stored in the restaurants table with the following structure:

- id: unique id of the restaurant;
- name: the restaurant's name.

As the table grew you decided to extend it, in particular add the description (VARCHAR(100), the description of the restaurant) and active (INT, 0 or 1 if it works or closed respectively) columns.

Add these two new columns to the restaurants table using the following rules for all records:

- the description should be set to "TBD" (for To Be Defined).
- active should be set to 1.

## Example

- The following table restaurants

| id   | name                     |
|------|--------------------------|
| 1    | The Big City Barbecue    |
| 2    | Roadhouse                |
| 3    | Hibiscus                 |
| 4    | The Waterfront Courtyard |
| 5    | The Royal Spices         |

- should become

| id   | name                     | description | active |
|------|--------------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1    | The Big City Barbecue    | TBD         | 1      |
| 2    | Roadhouse                | TBD         | 1      |
| 3    | Hibiscus                 | TBD         | 1      |
| 4    | The Waterfront Courtyard | TBD         | 1      |
| 5    | The Royal Spices         | TBD         | 1      |
