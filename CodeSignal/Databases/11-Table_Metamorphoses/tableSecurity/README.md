As the head of a company you decided that it's time to introduce access control and to restrict access to employees table for all the employees. The table has the following structure:

- id: unique employee id;
- name: the name of the employee;
- date_joined: the date the employee was hired;
- salary: the salary of the employee;

As a first step towards improving security you decided to create a view which would be used by the employees instead of direct access to the table.

Create a view which will select all the columns from the employees table but leave only id and name intact. date_joined column should contain the year the employee joined the company, and salary column should be filled with - (single dashes).

## Example

- The following table employees

| id  | name              | date_joined | salary |
|-----|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1   | Farah Dahlquist   | 2006-03-05  | 2000   |
| 2   | Yessenia Lininger | 2008-04-11  | 2500   |
| 3   | Justin Penrose    | 2009-12-12  | 2400   |
| 4   | Josphine Clickner | 2007-07-25  | 3000   |
| 5   | Linwood Mcquiston | 2011-01-15  | 4000   |

- the output should be

| id   | name              | date_joined | salary |
|------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| 1    | Farah Dahlquist   | 2006        | -      |
| 2    | Yessenia Lininger | 2008        | -      |
| 3    | Justin Penrose    | 2009        | -      |
| 4    | Josphine Clickner | 2007        | -      |
| 5    | Linwood Mcquiston | 2011        | -      |
