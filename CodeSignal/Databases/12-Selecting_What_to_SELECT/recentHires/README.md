Implement the missing code, denoted by ellipses. You may not modify the pre-existing code.
Your company has many different departments. Information about the employees working in these departments is stored in the **pr_department**, **it_department**, and **sales_department** tables, which have the following structures:

- **pr_department**:
  - id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  - name: the name of the employee;
  - date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
- **it_department**:
  - id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  - name: the name of the employee;
  - date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.
- **sales_department**:
  - id: the unique (for this department) employee ID;
  - name: the name of the employee;
  - date_joined: the date this employee was hired by your company.

Your task is to prepare a report that has the names of all the employees who were hired recently.

Given the **pr_department**, **it_department**, and **sales_department** tables, compose the result as follows: The resulting table should have one column <code>names</code> that contains the names of the last _five_ people to join _each_ department. The names of the employees from the **pr_department** should come first, followed by the **it_department**, and the **sales_department** will come last. The names of employees who work in the same department should be sorted in ascending order.

## Example

- For the following tables **pr_department**

| id  | name            | date_joined |
| --- | --------------- | ----------- |
| 2   | Bertha Neiman   | 2010-12-15  |
| 3   | Melissa Chace   | 2012-08-14  |
| 4   | Doyle Wiste     | 2015-01-02  |
| 8   | Libbie Troy     | 2016-03-04  |
| 15  | Noreen Bonner   | 2012-07-07  |
| 42  | Farah Dahlquist | 2006-12-12  |

**it_department**

| id  | name              | date_joined |
| --- | ----------------- | ----------- |
| 1   | Farah Dahlquist   | 2017-01-15  |
| 2   | Mohammed Claycomb | 2016-06-11  |
| 3   | Allen Reger       | 2015-08-12  |
| 5   | Jacque Fuhr       | 2013-04-01  |
| 4   | Joya Buss         | 2011-11-11  |
| 6   | Leonia Maultsby   | 2009-02-02  |

and **sales_department**

| id  | name          | date_joined |
| --- | ------------- | ----------- |

| 4   | Joya Buss     | 2008-08-08  |
| 7   | Edmond Kind   | 2007-07-07  |

the output should be

| names             |
| ----------------- |
| Bertha Neiman     |
| Doyle Wiste       |
| Libbie Troy       |
| Melissa Chace     |
| Noreen Bonner     |
| Allen Reger       |
| Farah Dahlquist   |
| Jacque Fuhr       |
| Joya Buss         |
