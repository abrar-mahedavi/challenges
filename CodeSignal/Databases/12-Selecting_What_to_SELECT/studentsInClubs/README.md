At the beginning of this academic year you composed a list of clubs and a list of their members. The gathered information is stored in your local database in two tables that have the following structures:

clubs
id: unique club id;
name: club name;
students
id: unique student id;
name: student name;
club_id: id of the club the student joined.
Each student can be a member only of a single club, and it is prohibited to drop a club until the year is over. However, several clubs were closed due to low attendance, and you need to update your database to reflect that. You have already updated the clubs table, and now the students table should be updated as well.

Given the clubs and students tables, return a table containing the records from students that have club_id equal to some id of clubs. The table should be sorted by students' ids.

## Example

- For the following table students

| id   | name                  | club_id |
|------|-----------------------|---------|
| 3    | Richard Gear          | 23      |
| 6    | Jennifer Offencerence | 11      |
| 14   | Obiten Kenobi         | 87      |
| 36   | Closece               | 87      |

- and clubs

| id  | name         |
|-----|--------------|
| 23  | Theater club |
| 64  | Soccer club  |
| 87  | Glee club    |

- the output should be

| id   | name          | club_id |
|------|---------------|---------|
| 3    | Richard Gear  | 23      |
| 14   | Obiten Kenobi | 87      |
| 36   | Closece       | 87      |
