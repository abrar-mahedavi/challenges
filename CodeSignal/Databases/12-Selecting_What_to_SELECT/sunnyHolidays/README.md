Winter is coming, and it’s going to be great! The weather forecasters promise that it’s going to be snowy, and there are a bunch of holidays so you’ll be able to spend entire days on the slopes. You want to know how many perfect ski days, which are sunny days that fall on holidays, there are going to be this winter.

You downloaded information about the weather forecast and saved it as the table weather, which consists of a single sunny_date column of type DATE. Information about the upcoming holidays is stored in the table holidays, which consists of a holiday_date column of type DATE. It is guaranteed that the elements of each table are unique.

Given the holidays and weather tables, return the dates that are present in both (i.e., their intersection). The resulting table should consist of a single ski_date column, and its elements should be sorted in ascending order.

## Example

- For the following tables holidays

| holiday_date |
|--------------|
| 2016-12-31   |
| 2017-01-02   |
| 2017-01-03   |
| 2017-01-20   |

- and weather

| sunny_date |
|------------|
| 2016-12-31 |
| 2016-12-25 |
| 2017-02-01 |
| 2017-01-02 |
| 2016-11-27 |
| 2017-01-01 |

- the output should be

| ski_date   |
|------------|
| 2016-12-31 |
| 2017-01-02 |

- The dates in this example are given in YYYY-MM-DD format.
