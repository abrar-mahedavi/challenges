Given a m x n matrix grid which is sorted in non-increasing order both row-wise and column-wise, return the number of negative numbers in grid.

## Example

```

Output: 8
Explanation: There are 8 negatives number in the matrix.
```

## Example

```
Input: grid = [[3,2],[1,0]]
Output: 0
```

## Constraints:

- m == grid.length 
- n == grid[i].length 
- 1 <= m, n <= 100 
- -100 <= grid[i][j] <= 100
