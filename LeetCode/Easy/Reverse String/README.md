# Reverse String

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array in-place with `O(1)` extra memory.

## Example

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

## Example

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```

## Constraints:

- 1 <= s.length <= 105
- s[i] is a printable ascii character.
